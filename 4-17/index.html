        <h1 class="quote"> I miss you dearly, and I hope all is well. It has been about
          a month since I have seen you and been able to touch you and hold you, and that makes me a sad fellow. I miss the shimmer in
          your eyes and the gentle flow of your voice. I miss the way your hair brushes me as you walk by. I miss kissing you and sharing the same breath, I miss the heat of your body when it's pushed up against me. I miss getting wrapped up in each other like a pretzel, getting as close to being one as we can. I miss cooking dinner with you and watching that 70's show. Well damn, Jackie! While I may be struggling to love you intentionally in all the ways you hope I could, do know that I think of you every minute of every day. If I really think hard enough, I feel your body against mine. I look forward to the day where we can embrace again, where we can be in contact, where we can share the same breath. Oh man are we going to have lots of dates. I wouldn't mind getting an AirBNB to get away and catch up on some much needed us time. We could go to DC and just sit by the water all day, we could finally get to sit on one of those swings by the water and watch the duckies swim by. This virus needs to get out of here, I have mini golf to play and noodles to eat with my woman! At least I get to see your beautiful face on snapchat though :)</h1>
